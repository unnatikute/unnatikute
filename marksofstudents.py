#Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N students in the class.
#Write functions to compute following:
#a) The average score of class
#b) Highest score and lowest score of class 
#c) Count of students who were absent for the test 
#d) Display mark with highest frequency.
